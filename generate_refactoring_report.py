A direct replacement for all of `chromadb`'s functionality with only `sqlite3` might be complex, especially for vector search capabilities. `sqlite3` could potentially replace the storage aspect if vector search is handled differently or removed).")

    report_lines.append("    - **Implication:** `onnxruntime` is likely used indirectly (e.g., called by another library that `crewai` imports) or dynamically loaded. Pinpointing specific files for refactoring requires a deeper audit of `crewai`'s features that might involve ONNX model inferencing. Any such feature would be a candidate for refactoring or removal if `onnxruntime` is unavailable.")

    report_lines.append("1.  **Conditional Import & Graceful Degradation:** If the feature is non-essential, wrap its usage in `try-except ImportError` blocks. The application can then run without the feature, possibly warning the user.")
    report_lines.append("2.  **Abstraction Layer:** If the functionality is essential, hide the specific library behind an abstraction layer (e.g., a base class or a set of functions). You can then create different implementations of this layer â€“ one using the problematic library, and another using an alternative (like `sqlite3` for some `chromadb` use cases, or a different model inference method if `onnxruntime` is out).")
    report_lines.append("3.  **Library Replacement:** Find a Termux-compatible library that offers similar functionality.")
    report_lines.append("4.  **Feature Removal:** If the feature is not critical and alternatives are too complex, consider removing it for the Termux-specific version or build.")
    report_lines.append("5.  **Stubbing Functionality:** For features where an alternative is hard, provide a stub that informs the user the feature is unavailable on Termux, rather than letting the application crash.")
