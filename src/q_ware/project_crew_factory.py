    # Using string placeholders for agents until their full definition and import path are confirmed
    # and to avoid import errors at this stage of scaffolding.
    # The actual crew composition will involve the ProjectArchitectAgent dynamically building
    # the full crew with coordinators and sub-agents. This factory might set up the
    # initial set of orchestrators that then build out the rest of the hierarchy.

    # The user feedback mentioned:
    # ProjectArchitectAgent "Assembles crew.yaml or Crew instance with correct Coordinators and tools"
    # IdeaInterpreterAgent -> ProjectArchitectAgent -> ExecutionManagerAgent -> FinalAssemblerAgent
    # TechVettingCouncilAgent is used by ProjectArchitectAgent.

    # So, the primary agents for this top-level orchestrating crew would be:
    # 1. IdeaInterpreterAgent (to process user_idea)
    # 2. ProjectArchitectAgent (to design and define the full working crew)
    # 3. ExecutionManagerAgent (to run the crew defined by ProjectArchitectAgent)
    # 4. FinalAssemblerAgent (to package results)

    # For now, we'll represent them as strings in the list for the Crew constructor,
    # as their actual instances are not yet fully defined for direct use here.
    # This part will need significant refinement during the "bottom-up build" phase.
