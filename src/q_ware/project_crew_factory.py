    Dynamically assembles and returns the main project orchestrator
    (e.g., TaskmasterAgent or a specific high-level crew) based on project specifications.

    For this initial version, it defaults to returning a TaskmasterAgent instance.
    Future enhancements could involve more complex logic to select/configure
    different orchestrators or crews based on project_specs.

    Args:
        project_specs (dict, optional): A dictionary containing project specifications.
                                        Currently unused but planned for future enhancements.
                                        Example: {"type": "web_app", "complexity": "high"}

    Returns:
        An instance of the selected project orchestrator (e.g., TaskmasterAgent).
