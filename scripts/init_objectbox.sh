# ObjectBox Initialization Script

# The primary database directory for ObjectBox is typically created by the
# CrewAI CLI application itself on startup (e.g., in src/crewai/cli/cli.py).
# Path: /data/data/com.termux/files/home/crewAI/db

# Regarding the embedding_model.tflite:
# This model should be placed in the 'models/' directory of your CrewAI project.
# Ensure 'models/embedding_model.tflite' exists.
# If you manage this model via a download or a separate process,
# you can add those commands here. For example:
#
# if [ ! -f "models/embedding_model.tflite" ]; then
#   echo "Embedding model not found. Please ensure it's downloaded or placed in models/ directory."
#   # Example: curl -L -o models/embedding_model.tflite https://example.com/path/to/your/model.tflite
# fi
