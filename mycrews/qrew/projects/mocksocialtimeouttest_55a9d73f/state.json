Introduction\n\nThis document describes the software architecture for the MockSocialTimeoutTest application, a full-stack platform designed to simulate and test the impact of social media timeouts on user behavior and system performance. The architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable.\n\n## 2. Architecture Overview\n\nThe architecture follows a layered approach, separating the presentation layer (front-end), application layer (back-end), and data layer. This separation of concerns promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability. A microservices approach is considered but deemed unnecessary for the initial scope of this project. A monolithic architecture with clear module boundaries will be employed initially, allowing for easier transition to microservices later if scaling demands.\n\n### 2.1.

Key Endpoint Definitions\n\n*   **Authentication Service:**\n    *   `POST /api/v1/register`: Register a new user.\n        *   Request: `{ email, username, password }`\n        *   Response: `{ user_id, email, username }`\n    *   `POST /api/v1/login`: Log in an existing user.\n        *   Request: `{ email, password }`\n        *   Response: `{ token }` (JWT)\n\n*   **User Management Service:**\n    *   `GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}`: Get user profile.\n        *   Request: (Authorization header with JWT)\n        *   Response: `{ user_id, email, username }`\n    *   `PUT /api/v1/users/{user_id}`: Update user profile.\n        *   Request: `{ username, password }` (Authorization header with JWT)\n        *   Response: `{ user_id, email, username }`\n    *   `POST /api/v1/users/{user_id}/accounts`: Link social media account.\n        *   Request: `{ platform, access_token, refresh_token }` (Authorization header with JWT)\n        *   Response: `{ account_id, platform, account_username }`\n    *   `DELETE /api/v1/users/{user_id}/accounts/{account_id}`: Unlink social media account.\n         *   Request: (Authorization header with JWT)\n         *   Response: `{ success: true }`\n\n*   **Timeout Management Service:**\n    *   `POST /api/v1/timeouts`: Create a new timeout configuration.\n        *   Request: `{ start_time, end_time, frequency, social_media_accounts, simulation_pattern }` (Authorization header with JWT)\n        *   Response: `{ configuration_id, start_time, end_time, frequency }`\n    *   `GET /api/v1/timeouts/{configuration_id}`: Get a specific timeout configuration.\n        *   Request: (Authorization header with JWT)\n        *   Response: `{ configuration_id, start_time, end_time, frequency, social_media_accounts, simulation_pattern }`\n    *   `PUT /api/v1/timeouts/{configuration_id}`: Update a timeout configuration.\n        *   Request: `{ start_time, end_time, frequency, social_media_accounts, simulation_pattern }` (Authorization header with JWT)\n        *   Response: `{ configuration_id, start_time, end_time, frequency }`\n     *   `DELETE /api/v1/timeouts/{configuration_id}`: Delete a timeout configuration.\n         *   Request: (Authorization header with JWT)\n         *   Response: `{ success: true }`\n\n*   **Reporting Service:**\n    *   `GET /api/v1/reports/usage`: Get usage statistics for a user.\n        *   Request: `{ start_date, end_date }` (Authorization header with JWT)\n        *   Response: `{ total_time_on_social_media, average_daily_usage, ... }`\n\n## 6. Integration Points with External Services\n\n*   **Social Media APIs (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram):** Activity Simulation Service integrates with these APIs to simulate user activity. OAuth is used for authentication and authorization. Rate limits are strictly respected.\n*   **Email Service (AWS SES):** Authentication Service uses this to send registration confirmation emails and Timeout Management Service sends timeout notifications.\n*   **Redis/RabbitMQ:** Used for background task processing for scheduling and activity simulation.\n\n## 7. Considerations for Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 7.1. Security Plan\n\n*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.\n*   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources.\n*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, access tokens) at rest and in transit using appropriate encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).\n*   **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n*   **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.\n*   **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to restrict access from unauthorized domains.\n\n### 7.2. Scalability Strategy\n\n*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Deploy multiple instances of the API Gateway and application servers behind a load balancer to handle increased traffic.\n*   **Database Scaling:** Use database replication and sharding to distribute data and improve performance.  Consider read replicas for reporting.\n*   **Caching:** Implement caching at various levels (e.g., CDN for static assets, Redis for frequently accessed data) to reduce database load and improve response times.\n*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle long-running tasks asynchronously, improving responsiveness.\n*   **Microservices Architecture (Future):**  Consider migrating to a microservices architecture if the application grows significantly in complexity and scale.\n\n### 7.3. Performance\n\n*   **Code Optimization:** Optimize code for performance, including efficient algorithms and data structures.\n*   **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries and indexing to improve data retrieval times.\n*   **Load Testing:** Conduct regular load testing to identify and address performance bottlenecks.\n*   **Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring to track performance metrics and identify potential issues.\n*   **CDN:** Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static assets and reduce latency for users around the world.\n\n### 7.4. Reliability\n\n*   **Redundancy:** Implement redundancy at all levels of the architecture to ensure high availability.\n*   **Automated Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement automated monitoring to detect and alert on system failures.\n*   **Backup and Recovery:** Implement regular backups and a well-defined recovery plan to protect against data loss.\n*   **Disaster Recovery:** Implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in the event of a major outage.\n\n### 7.5. Usability\n\n*   **Intuitive User Interface:** Design a user interface that is easy to use and intuitive.\n*   **Consistent Design:** Maintain a consistent design across all pages and components.\n*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.\n*   **User Feedback:** Gather user feedback regularly to identify areas for improvement.\n\n## 8. Addressing Identified Ambiguities/Questions\n\n*   **What specific social media platforms should be supported?**  Initially, support Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Add more based on user demand.\n*   **What level of customization should be allowed for activity simulation patterns?**  Provide pre-defined patterns (e.g., \"like every 5th post\", \"comment on trending topics\") and allow advanced users to define custom patterns using a simple scripting language or JSON configuration.\n*   **What reporting metrics are most important to users?** Focus on time spent on each platform, frequency of use, time of day with most usage, and comparison before/during/after timeouts. Gather user feedback for additional metrics.\n*   **What are the detailed requirements for the user interface design?**  This requires a separate UI/UX design process.  The architecture supports any modern web UI framework like React.\n*   **What are the specific legal requirements for data privacy and security?**  Consult with legal counsel to ensure compliance with applicable data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Implement necessary data protection measures.\n\n## 9. Conclusion\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the software architecture for the MockSocialTimeoutTest application. The architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable, aligning with best practices for full-stack development. The technology stack and design decisions are justified based on the project's requirements and constraints. Continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation are crucial to ensuring the system meets evolving needs and remains effective.\n```",
