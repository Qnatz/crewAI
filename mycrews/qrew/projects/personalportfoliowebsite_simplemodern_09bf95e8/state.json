Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the technical requirements for the 'PersonalPortfolioWebsite_SimpleModern' project. The goal is to create a single-page, responsive personal portfolio website with a clean and modern design, focusing on simplicity and professionalism.\n\n## 2. User Stories\n\nAs a visitor to the website, I want to:\n\n*   **US 1: Easily navigate to different sections** so I can quickly find the information I'm interested in.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   The site has a fixed or sticky navigation bar at the top.\n        *   Clicking on a navigation link scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section on the single page.\n        *   The navigation clearly labels the main sections (e.g., Home, About, Projects).\n*   **US 2: Understand who the site owner is and their profession** so I can get a quick overview.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   There is a prominent header section at the top of the page.\n        *   The header displays the site owner's name and title.\n*   **US 3: Learn about the site owner's background and skills** so I can understand their expertise.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   There is a dedicated \"About Me\" section.\n        *   This section contains a brief description of the site owner.\n*   **US 4: See examples of the site owner's work** so I can evaluate their capabilities.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   There is a \"Projects\" section.\n        *   This section displays 2-3 project placeholders.\n        *   Each project placeholder includes a title, a brief description, and an image or placeholder graphic.\n*   **US 5: Know the copyright information** so I understand the usage rights.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   There is a footer section at the bottom of the page.\n        *   The footer includes copyright information, typically with the current year and site owner's name.\n*   **US 6: View the website correctly on any device size** so I can access the content easily on desktop, tablet, or mobile.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   The website layout and content adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (mobile-responsive).\n        *   All content is readable and navigation is usable on smaller screens without horizontal scrolling.\n\nAs the site owner, I want to:\n\n*   **US 7: Easily update project details** so I can keep my portfolio current.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   The project details (title, description, image) can be updated without requiring significant code changes. (Note: This implies a simple content structure, possibly static data that is easy to modify).\n\n## 3. Functional Requirements\n\n*   **FR 1: Navigation:** Implement a single-page navigation system that uses anchor links to scroll to specific sections (Header/Home, About, Projects). The navigation bar should be fixed or sticky at the top.\n*   **FR 2: Header Section:** Implement a header section at the top of the page containing the user's name and title.\n*   **FR 3: About Me Section:** Implement an \"About Me\" section containing a paragraph of text about the user.\n*   **FR 4: Projects Section:** Implement a \"Projects\" section capable of displaying 2-3 project items. Each project item must include a title, a description, and an image or placeholder.\n*   **FR 5: Footer Section:** Implement a footer section containing copyright information (e.g., \"\u00a9 [Year] [Your Name]\").\n*   **FR 6: Responsiveness:** The layout and design must adapt automatically to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   **FR 7: Content Management (Simple):** Provide a simple mechanism (e.g., modifying a data file or configuration within the codebase) for the site owner to update the text content and project details (title, description, image path) without needing to rebuild the entire application structure.\n\n## 4. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n*   **NFR 1: Performance:** The website must load quickly. Aim for a load time of under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection. Image optimization should be implemented.\n*   **NFR 2: Responsiveness:** The website must be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices and screen sizes. (See FR 6 - this is a critical non-functional aspect driving the functional implementation).\n*   **NFR 3: Usability:** The navigation should be intuitive and the layout clean and easy to understand.\n*   **NFR 4: Browser Compatibility:** The website should function correctly on modern web browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   **NFR 5: Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-structured and documented to allow for future updates and additions (like adding more projects or a contact form).\n*   **NFR 6: Security:** Standard web security practices should be followed (e.g., using HTTPS if deployed). Given it's a static site, security concerns are minimal but important for deployment best practices.\n\n## 5. Data Requirements\n\n*   **DR 1: User Information:**\n    *   Name (String)\n    *   Title/Profession (String)\n    *   About Me text (String, potentially multi-paragraph)\n*   **DR 2: Project Information (for each of 2-3 projects):**\n    *   Project Title (String)\n    *   Project Description (String, multi-paragraph allowed)\n    *   Project Image (Image file path/URL, e.g., JPG, PNG, WebP)\n*   **DR 3: Copyright Information:**\n    *   Copyright Year (Integer, dynamically generated or static)\n    *   Copyright Holder Name (String)\n*   **Data Storage:** Data can be stored statically within the codebase (e.g., JSON file, JavaScript object, or directly in HTML/Markdown if a static site generator is used) as the requirement is simple update, not dynamic database management.\n\n## 6. Glossary of Terms\n\n*   **Responsive Design:** A web design approach that makes web pages render well on various screen sizes and resolutions.\n*   **Single-Page Application (SPA) / Single-Page Website:** A website that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates that page as the user interacts, rather than loading entirely new pages from a server. (Note: While often implemented with frameworks, a simple static site using anchor links is functionally a 'single-page' experience in terms of navigation).\n*   **Anchor Links:** Links that point to a specific section within the same web page (e.g., `<a href=\"#section-name\">`).\n\n## 7. Identified Ambiguities / Questions\n\n*   **AQ 1: Project Image Specifications:** Are there any size, aspect ratio, or file type requirements for the project images? (e.g., maximum file size, recommended dimensions for consistent layout).\n*   **AQ 2: Number of Projects:** The brief states \"2-3 project placeholders\". Should the design accommodate easily adding more projects later, or is the hard limit 3 for the initial scope? The user story implies ease of adding more, but the brief states \"2-3\". Clarification needed on scope vs. future-proofing.\n*   **AQ 3: \"Clean and Modern Design\":** This is subjective. Are there specific design preferences, examples, or a preferred styling guide/framework (e.g., Material Design, Bootstrap, a specific UI kit, or completely custom CSS)?\n*   **AQ 4: Simple Content Update Mechanism:** The requirement is 'easy to update'. What is the preferred technical approach? (e.g., editing a JSON file, using a static site generator with Markdown files, simple inline HTML edits - the latter being least maintainable). This impacts development approach.\n*   **AQ 5: Deployment Environment:** Will this be hosted on a specific platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, shared hosting)? This could impact technical choices (e.g., serverless functions are out for a purely static site).\n\n```\nThought: I have gathered all the necessary information from the prompt and structured it into the required technical requirements document format.

      "architecture_document_markdown": "```markdown\n# Software Architecture Document: PersonalPortfolioWebsite_SimpleModern\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the software architecture for the 'PersonalPortfolioWebsite_SimpleModern' project.  The architecture focuses on a simple, static website built using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript, adhering to the project constraints and technical vision of lightweight, fast-loading, and maintainable code.\n\n## 2. High-Level System Diagrams\n\n### 2.1 Component Diagram\n\n```plantuml\n@startuml\nskinparam componentStyle uml2\ncomponent \"HTML Structure\" as HTML {\n    file \"index.html\"\n}\ncomponent \"CSS Styling\" as CSS {\n    file \"style.css\"\n}\ncomponent \"JavaScript (Optional)\" as JS {\n    file \"script.js\"\n}\ncomponent \"Data (JSON)\" as Data {\n    file \"data.json\"\n}\n\nHTML -right-> CSS : Uses\nHTML -right-> JS : Uses (Optional)\nHTML -right-> Data : Uses\n\n@enduml\n```\n\n**Description:** The website consists of three core components: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and optional JavaScript for minimal interactivity (e.g., smooth scrolling).  The data (user information, project details) is stored in a separate JSON file for easy updating.\n\n### 2.2 Deployment Diagram\n\n```plantuml\n@startuml\nnode \"Web Server (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages)\" as Server {\n    file \"index.html\"\n    file \"style.css\"\n    file \"script.js\"\n    file \"data.json\"\n}\nactor \"User\" as User\n\nUser -- Server : HTTP Request\nServer -- User : HTTP Response (HTML, CSS, JS)\n\n@enduml\n```\n\n**Description:** The static website files (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON) are deployed to a web server (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any static hosting provider).  Users access the website through HTTP requests, and the server responds with the static files.\n\n\n## 3. Technology Stack\n\n*   **Frontend:**\n    *   HTML5: Semantic markup for website structure.\n    *   CSS3: Styling and layout.  Consider using a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS for rapid development and responsive design if time permits.\n    *   JavaScript (ES6+):  Minimal usage for smooth scrolling animations and potentially future enhancements (contact form, etc.).\n\n*   **Data Storage:** JSON file.\n\n*   **Deployment:** Netlify, GitHub Pages, or similar static hosting service.\n\n\n## 4. Data Model Design\n\nThe data model is straightforward, utilizing a single JSON file (`data.json`) to store all website content.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"title\": \"Software Engineer\",\n    \"about\": \"A paragraph about John Doe...\"\n  },\n  \"projects\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Project 1\",\n      \"description\": \"Description of Project 1...\",\n      \"image\": \"project1.jpg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Project 2\",\n      \"description\": \"Description of Project 2...\",\n      \"image\": \"project2.jpg\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Project 3\",\n      \"description\": \"Description of Project 3...\",\n      \"image\": \"project3.jpg\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"copyright\": {\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"holder\": \"John Doe\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## 5. API Design Guidelines (N/A)\n\nNo APIs are required for this static website.\n\n\n## 6. Integration Points with External Services (N/A)\n\nNo external services are integrated in this version.\n\n\n## 7. Considerations for Non-Functional Requirements\n\n*   **Security:**  Since this is a static website, security risks are minimal.  However, HTTPS should be used for all deployments to encrypt communication between the user's browser and the web server.  Content Security Policy (CSP) headers can be added for further protection against XSS attacks.\n\n*   **Scalability:** The static nature of the website inherently provides excellent scalability. The web server can easily handle a large number of concurrent users.  CDN (Content Delivery Network) can be used for further optimization of load times and geographic reach.\n\n*   **Performance:**  Image optimization (using tools like TinyPNG or similar) is crucial for fast loading times.  Minification and bundling of CSS and JavaScript files (if using a JS framework) can further improve performance.  Lazy loading for images can significantly improve the initial load time.\n\n*   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-structured, using semantic HTML, modular CSS, and well-commented JavaScript.  A consistent coding style should be followed throughout the project.  Version control (Git) is essential for tracking changes and collaboration.\n\n*   **Usability:**  Intuitive navigation and a clean, uncluttered layout are key to a good user experience.   Consider using accessible color palettes and adhering to WCAG guidelines.  Thorough testing on different devices and browsers is crucial.\n\n*   **Responsiveness:** The use of CSS media queries and a responsive framework (optional Tailwind CSS) will ensure the website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.\n\n\n## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis architecture provides a solid foundation for building a simple, modern, and maintainable personal portfolio website.  The emphasis on static content and minimal JavaScript ensures fast loading times and easy deployment.  Future enhancements, such as adding a contact form or blog section, can be implemented with minimal disruption to the existing architecture.\n```",
