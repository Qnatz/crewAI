Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the technical requirements for the 'ProductShowcaseParallaxPage' project. The goal is to develop a single-page website utilizing parallax scrolling effects to visually showcase company products. The page must be responsive across various devices and include design assets and documentation as key deliverables.\n\n### 2. User Stories\n\nAs a **website visitor**, I want to:\n\n*   **US 1.1:** View products presented with engaging visual effects (like parallax scrolling) so that I am more interested in exploring the offerings.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   The page loads successfully.\n        *   Scrolling reveals different sections or product information with a distinct parallax effect.\n        *   The parallax effect is smooth and does not cause noticeable lag or jank.\n*   **US 1.2:** Navigate easily through the product sections so that I can find information quickly.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   There are clear visual cues separating product sections.\n        *   (Potential Ambiguity - Navigation Method: How will users navigate? Menu? Scroll only? Need clarification.)\n*   **US 1.3:** See product details (images, descriptions, key features) clearly displayed within their respective sections.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   Each product section includes at least one image and a textual description.\n        *   Key features for each product are listed or highlighted.\n        *   Product information is legible on all supported screen sizes.\n*   **US 1.4:** View the website correctly on my desktop, tablet, or mobile phone so that I have a consistent experience regardless of device.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   The layout and content adjust appropriately for different screen widths (responsive design).\n        *   Parallax effects are either maintained or gracefully degraded on mobile devices where performance might be an issue.\n        *   All content is accessible and usable on touch interfaces.\n\nAs a **company administrator** (implied future need, or for content management - requires clarification), I might want to:\n\n*   **US 2.1:** Easily update product information and images without developer intervention (requires clarification - is a CMS needed or is content hardcoded?).\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** (Dependent on clarification)\n\n### 3. Functional Requirements\n\n*   **FR 3.1:** The website MUST be a single-page application or a single HTML page structure.\n*   **FR 3.2:** The website MUST implement parallax scrolling effects on one or more background elements as the user scrolls.\n*   **FR 3.3:** The website MUST display multiple distinct sections, each dedicated to showcasing a specific product or product category.\n*   **FR 3.4:** Each product section MUST include product imagery and descriptive text.\n*   **FR 3.5:** The website MUST include a header and potentially a footer section (requires clarification).\n*   **FR 3.6:** The website MUST be navigable (either by scrolling, or via a navigation menu if implemented per US 1.2 clarification).\n*   **FR 3.7:** The website MUST display design assets provided by the design team.\n*   **FR 3.8:** The final deliverable MUST include the complete, functional website code.\n*   **FR 3.9:** The final deliverable MUST include all design assets used.\n*   **FR 3.10:** The final deliverable MUST include comprehensive technical documentation.\n\n### 4. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n*   **NFR 4.1 Performance:**\n    *   The page load time SHOULD be optimized to be as fast as possible (e.g., under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection).\n    *   Parallax effects SHOULD be smooth (target 60fps) and NOT cause excessive CPU/GPU usage or lag.\n    *   Image and asset loading SHOULD be optimized (e.g., lazy loading, appropriate formats and compression).\n*   **NFR 4.2 Responsiveness:**\n    *   The website MUST be fully responsive, adapting its layout and elements gracefully to screen sizes from small mobile phones (e.g., 320px width) up to large desktop displays.\n*   **NFR 4.3 Browser Compatibility:**\n    *   The website SHOULD be compatible with modern web browsers (e.g., latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Specific older browser support requires clarification.\n*   **NFR 4.4 Accessibility:**\n    *   The website SHOULD adhere to basic web accessibility standards (e.g., appropriate alt text for images, keyboard navigation where applicable). (Specific compliance level requires clarification - e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level AA?)\n*   **NFR 4.5 Security:**\n    *   As a static page, security concerns are minimal, but standard web security practices should be followed (e.g., using HTTPS if deployed).\n*   **NFR 4.6 Maintainability:**\n    *   The code MUST be well-structured, clean, and documented to facilitate future updates.\n*   **NFR 4.7 Usability:**\n    *   The overall user experience should be intuitive and engaging, with clear calls to action if applicable (requires clarification - are there calls to action?).\n\n### 5.

Glossary of Terms\n\n*   **Parallax Scrolling:** A web design technique where the background content moves at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling, creating an illusion of depth.\n*   **Responsive Design:** A web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience\u2014easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling\u2014across a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors).\n\n### 7. Identified Ambiguities/Questions\n\n*   **Navigation Method (US 1.2):** Will the page have a fixed navigation menu, or will users primarily navigate by scrolling?\n*   **Content Management (US 2.1):** Is there a requirement for administrators to update content without developer intervention (e.g., using a CMS), or will product information be hardcoded into the page?\n*   **Header/Footer (FR 3.5):** What specific content or functionality is expected in the header and footer sections? (e.g., Company logo, contact info, social links?)\n*   **Call to Actions (NFR 4.7):** Are there specific calls to action required within the product sections (e.g., \"Buy Now\", \"Learn More\", \"Contact Us\")? If so, where do they link?\n*   **Specific Browser Support (NFR 4.3):** Beyond modern browsers, are there specific older browser versions that need to be supported?\n*   **Accessibility Compliance Level (NFR 4.4):** What is the target accessibility compliance level (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level A, AA, AAA)?\n*   **Product Data Structure (Data Format):** How should the product information be structured and loaded? Hardcoded HTML, JSON file, or something else?\n*   **Number of Products/Sections:** Approximately how many products or sections are expected on the page? This impacts performance considerations.\n*   **Complexity of Parallax:** How complex should the parallax effect be? Simple background movement or multiple layers/elements moving at different speeds?\n\nThis document will be updated as these ambiguities are clarified through further discussions.",
      "architecture_document_markdown": "# ProductShowcaseParallaxPage: Software Architecture Document\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the software architecture for the `ProductShowcaseParallaxPage` project.  The architecture prioritizes clean code, maintainability, scalability, and performance.  Given the requirement for a single-page application with parallax scrolling, a client-side rendering approach using modern JavaScript frameworks is most suitable.  The lack of a pre-defined tech stack allows for optimal technology selection based on project needs.\n\n## 2. High-Level System Diagram\n\nThe system consists of a single HTML page, client-side JavaScript for parallax effects and responsiveness, and potentially a backend service for data management (depending on future CMS requirements).\n\n**Component Diagram:**\n\n```\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n|   Web Browser   | <--> | Client-Side JS  | <--> | (Optional) API |\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n       ^                                         |\n       |                                         v\n       +---------------------------------------+-----------------+\n                                                 | Data Storage    |\n                                                 +-----------------+\n```\n\n\n**Deployment Diagram:**\n\nThe application will be deployed as a static website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, assets) to a web hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).  The optional API would be deployed separately to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) or a serverless environment.\n\n\n## 3. Technology Stack\n\n* **Frontend:** React.js (for component-based architecture and ease of maintenance),  SCSS (for maintainable CSS),  Webpack (for module bundling and optimization).  Parallax libraries like `react-parallax` or `parallax.js` will be evaluated and chosen based on performance and ease of integration.\n* **Backend (Optional):** Node.js with Express.js (lightweight and scalable for potential future CMS functionality).  A NoSQL database like MongoDB (flexible schema for evolving data needs) would be considered.\n* **Data Storage (Optional):** MongoDB (if backend API is implemented).\n\n\n## 4. Data Model Design\n\nIf a backend API is implemented (for future CMS capability), the data model would be simple:\n\n**Product Schema:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"productId\": \"uniqueId\",\n  \"productName\": \"Product Name\",\n  \"description\": \"Product Description\",\n  \"features\": [\"Feature 1\", \"Feature 2\"],\n  \"images\": [\"image1.jpg\", \"image2.png\"],\n  \"specifications\": {\n    \"spec1\": \"Value 1\",\n    \"spec2\": \"Value 2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis schema can be easily extended to incorporate more product details as needed.\n\n\n## 5. API Design Guidelines\n\n**(Only if a backend is implemented)**\n\nThe API would use RESTful principles.  Key endpoints:\n\n* **GET /products:** Returns a list of products.\n* **GET /products/{productId}:** Returns a specific product by ID.\n* **POST /products:** Creates a new product.\n* **PUT /products/{productId}:** Updates a product.\n* **DELETE /products/{productId}:** Deletes a product.\n\nResponses would be in JSON format.\n\n\n## 6. Integration Points\n\nThere are no planned integrations with external services initially.  Future integrations could include analytics platforms (Google Analytics) or marketing automation tools.\n\n\n## 7. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n* **Performance:** Lazy loading for images, code splitting (for React), efficient parallax library selection, and optimized asset compression will be implemented to ensure fast page load times and smooth scrolling.  Performance testing will be conducted throughout development.\n* **Responsiveness:** Responsive design principles will be strictly followed using CSS media queries and flexible layouts.  Mobile-first approach will be considered for optimal performance on mobile devices.\n* **Browser Compatibility:**  Testing across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) will be performed.  Consideration will be given to graceful degradation for older browsers, if specified.\n* **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance will be targeted.  Alt text for images, proper heading structure, keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast will be ensured.\n* **Security:** HTTPS will be used for deployment.  Security best practices will be followed, minimizing potential vulnerabilities in the code.  Security considerations are minimal for a static site but will be addressed if a backend is implemented.\n* **Maintainability:** Clean code, well-structured components (React), and thorough documentation will ensure easy maintenance and future updates.  Version control using Git will be employed.\n* **Usability:** User testing will be conducted to evaluate the overall user experience and ensure intuitive navigation.\n\n\n\n## 8.  Ambiguity Resolution and Clarifications\n\nThe following assumptions were made based on the provided document:\n\n* **Navigation Method (US 1.2):**  Primary navigation will be through scrolling, supplemented potentially by a simple, concise header navigation (if a header is included).\n* **Content Management (US 2.1):** Initially, product information will be hardcoded in the application.  Future implementation of a CMS (using the optional backend API) will be considered separately.\n* **Header/Footer (FR 3.5):** A header containing the company logo and possibly a simple navigation menu is planned.  A footer containing copyright information is also planned.\n* **Call to Actions (NFR 4.7):** Specific calls to action will be determined in collaboration with the design team.\n* **Specific Browser Support (NFR 4.3):** Modern browsers will be primarily supported.\n* **Accessibility Compliance Level (NFR 4.4):** WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance will be the target.\n* **Product Data Structure (Data Format):** Initially, product data will be hardcoded into the React components.  If a CMS is implemented, a JSON-based structure will be utilized (as described in section 4).\n* **Number of Products/Sections:** The architecture can accommodate a variable number of products/sections; optimization techniques (lazy loading, etc.) will address potential performance challenges with a larger number of products.\n* **Complexity of Parallax:**  Parallax effects will be relatively straightforward, focusing on background movement and potentially subtle layering.\n\nThis architecture provides a solid foundation for the `ProductShowcaseParallaxPage` project, accommodating future scalability and maintainability while prioritizing performance and user experience.  The optional backend API allows for a future-proof design that can adapt to more complex content management needs without significant architectural overhaul.",

        "documentation/README.md": "# ProductShowcaseParallaxPage Project Documentation\n\nThis document provides an overview of the ProductShowcaseParallaxPage project, including integration details, usage instructions, and troubleshooting information.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nThe ProductShowcaseParallaxPage is a single-page website designed to showcase company products using a parallax scrolling effect.  The project consists of a backend component (Python), a frontend component (React), and mobile adaptation logic.\n\n## Integration Details\n\n### Backend (Python)\n\nThe backend component, `generate_plan.py`, generates a JSON object containing product data. This data is crucial for populating the product showcase sections on the frontend.  The script can be run independently and the output JSON file is then consumed by the React application.\n\n\n### Frontend (React)\n\nThe React frontend handles the display of product information and implements the parallax scrolling effect.  It fetches the product data from the backend (or uses a hardcoded backup). The frontend is responsible for the user interface and user experience.\n\n### Mobile Adaptation\n\nMobile adaptation is implemented by conditionally rendering a message within the React application.  If the backend call fails or no product data is available, a concise message is displayed, providing a graceful fallback experience.\n\n### DevOps (Terraform)\n\nDeployment is managed using Terraform.  The Terraform configuration handles infrastructure provisioning. Successful backend and frontend integration is a prerequisite for deployment.\n\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\n1. **Backend:** Run `generate_plan.py` to generate the `product_data.json` file.\n2. **Frontend:**  Navigate to the React project directory and run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the development server.  The React application will fetch data from `product_data.json`.\n3. **Deployment:** Use the provided Terraform configuration to deploy the application to the target environment.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* **Backend Errors:** Check the `generate_plan.py` logs for any errors during product data generation.\n* **Frontend Errors:** Examine the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors in the React application.\n* **Data Fetching Issues:** Verify that the React application is correctly fetching and parsing the JSON data from the backend.  Check network requests in the browser's developer tools.\n* **Parallax Scrolling Issues:**  Ensure that the necessary libraries and configurations for parallax scrolling are correctly implemented in the React code.\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n* Implement a robust content management system (CMS) to manage product data dynamically.\n* Add more sophisticated parallax effects and animations.\n* Integrate analytics tracking to monitor website usage.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions or issues, please contact the development team.",
        "documentation/architecture.md": "# ProductShowcaseParallaxPage Architecture\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the architecture of the ProductShowcaseParallaxPage project, a single-page website showcasing company products using parallax scrolling.  The architecture is designed for scalability and maintainability, separating concerns into distinct backend, frontend, and mobile adaptation components.\n\n## 2. Components\n\n* **Backend (Python):** A Python script (`generate_plan.py`) responsible for generating product data in JSON format. This data includes product images, descriptions, and key features.  Initially, this data may be hardcoded for development and testing, but the design allows for future integration with a content management system (CMS).\n\n* **Frontend (React):** A React application responsible for rendering the user interface and handling the parallax scrolling effect.  It fetches product data from the backend component and dynamically updates the page content.  The frontend utilizes a component-based architecture for modularity and maintainability.  Error handling is implemented to gracefully handle cases where data fetching from the backend fails.\n\n* **Mobile Adaptation:** A simple informational message displayed on mobile devices if the backend data retrieval fails. This message informs the user that product information is temporarily unavailable.  This is implemented within the React application using conditional rendering.\n\n* **DevOps (Terraform):** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) managed by Terraform. This ensures consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments. The Terraform configuration is separate from the application code, enabling independent infrastructure management.\n\n\n## 3. Data Flow\n\n1. The user accesses the ProductShowcaseParallaxPage website.\n2. The React frontend initiates a request to the Python backend (`generate_plan.py`) to fetch product data.\n3. The Python backend processes the request and returns a JSON object containing product information.\n4. The React frontend receives the JSON data and renders the parallax scrolling page, dynamically populating the content based on the received data.\n5. If the backend request fails, a mobile adaptation message is displayed instead of the product showcase.\n\n\n## 4. Technology Stack\n\n* **Backend:** Python\n* **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, CSS\n* **Infrastructure:** Terraform, AWS (or other cloud provider - adaptable)\n\n\n## 5. Deployment\n\nThe application is deployed using Terraform, which manages the infrastructure provisioning and deployment process.  The deployment process is automated to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments.\n\n\n## 6. Future Considerations\n\n* **Integration with CMS:**  Replace the hardcoded product data in the backend with integration to a CMS for easier content management.\n* **Advanced Parallax Effects:** Implement more sophisticated parallax scrolling effects for enhanced user experience.\n* **Analytics Integration:** Integrate analytics tracking to monitor user engagement and website performance."
