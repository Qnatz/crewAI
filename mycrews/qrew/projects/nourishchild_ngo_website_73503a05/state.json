      "architecture_document_markdown": "# NourishChild-NGO-Website: Software Architecture Document\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the software architecture for the NourishChild NGO website, a web-only application designed to communicate the NGO's mission, activities, and impact.  The architecture prioritizes scalability, maintainability, security, and ease of use.\n\n## 2. High-Level System Diagram\n\n**(Component Diagram)**\n\n```\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n| Web Frontend    | <--> | API Gateway     | <--> | Backend Services|\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n       ^                                               |\n       |                                               |\n       +-----------------------------------------------+\n                                       |\n                                       V\n                               +-----------------+\n                               | Database        |\n                               +-----------------+\n\n```\n\n**(Deployment Diagram)**\n\n```\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n| Load Balancer    | <--> | Web Servers     | <--> | Database Server |\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n       ^                                               |\n       |                                               |\n       +-----------------------------------------------+\n                                       |\n                                       V\n                               +-----------------+\n                               | CDN             |\n                               +-----------------+\n```\n\n\n## 3. Technology Stack\n\n* **Frontend:** React.js (for dynamic UI and component reusability), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,  Webpack (for bundling and optimization).\n* **API Gateway:** Kong API Gateway (for routing, authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring).\n* **Backend Services:** Node.js with Express.js (for its speed, scalability, and large community support), utilizing a RESTful API architecture.\n* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for relational data management, scalability, and ACID properties).\n* **Payment Gateway:** Stripe (chosen for its ease of integration and robust security features).  *Note:*  This can be easily swapped for PayPal or another provider if needed.\n* **CMS:**  Directly integrated into the backend using a custom admin panel built with React.js.  This provides more control and security compared to using a separate, third-party CMS.\n* **CDN:** Cloudflare (for content delivery and improved performance).\n\n**Justification:** This stack balances ease of development, scalability, and security. React.js provides a robust frontend framework, Node.js/Express.js offers a performant and scalable backend, and PostgreSQL ensures data integrity.  Kong API Gateway provides a crucial layer for security and management.\n\n\n## 4. Data Model Design\n\nThe data model will center around the following key entities:\n\n* **Users:**  Stores information about administrators and potentially registered volunteers (if future features require user accounts).  Fields include `id`, `username`, `password`, `role`, `email`.\n* **Pages:**  Represents website pages (e.g., About Us, Get Involved, Our Impact).  Fields include `id`, `title`, `content`, `slug`, `page_type`.\n* **Projects:** Represents NGO projects, including `id`, `title`, `description`, `images`, `videos`, `status`, `start_date`, `end_date`.\n* **Donations:**  Records donations, including `id`, `donor_name`, `amount`, `donation_date`, `payment_id` (from Stripe), `email`.\n\nRelationships:\n\n* One-to-many relationship between Users and Donations (one user can make multiple donations).\n* One-to-many relationship between Pages and Users (one user can edit multiple pages).\n* One-to-many relationship between Projects and Pages (one page can describe multiple projects).\n\n\n## 5. API Design Guidelines\n\nThe API will follow RESTful principles, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  Key endpoints include:\n\n* `/pages`:  GET (retrieve all pages), POST (create a page), PUT (update a page), DELETE (delete a page).\n* `/projects`: GET (retrieve all projects), POST (create a project), PUT (update a project), DELETE (delete a project).\n* `/donations`: POST (process a donation \u2013 integrates with Stripe).\n* `/contact`: POST (submit a contact form).\n* `/admin/login`: POST (admin login).\n* `/admin/pages`:  (Admin-specific endpoints for managing pages, similar to public `/pages` but with enhanced permissions).\n* `/admin/projects`: (Admin-specific endpoints for managing projects).\n\n\n## 6. Integration Points\n\n* **Stripe:**  The `/donations` endpoint integrates directly with the Stripe API to process secure payments.\n* **Email Service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun):**  Integration for sending donation confirmations and contact form responses.  This will be a configurable option.\n\n\n## 7. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n* **Security:**  Input validation, parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, HTTPS for all communication, secure storage of sensitive data (passwords, donation information), regular security audits.  The Kong API Gateway will also enforce authentication and authorization policies.\n* **Scalability:**  The architecture is designed for scalability using a microservices approach (backend services), load balancing, and a scalable database (PostgreSQL).  CDN will offload static content.\n* **Performance:**  Caching strategies (e.g., Redis), optimized database queries, code optimization, and use of a CDN will improve performance.  Regular performance testing and monitoring will be essential.\n* **Usability:**  Intuitive navigation, clear design, user-friendly forms.\n* **Accessibility:**  Adherence to WCAG guidelines during frontend development.\n* **Maintainability:**  Modular design, well-documented code, automated testing, and use of version control (Git).\n\n\n## 8.  Ambiguity Resolution\n\nThe document addresses the ambiguities raised in the original specification by proposing concrete solutions and technology choices.  For example, Stripe is selected as the payment gateway, and a custom admin panel replaces a generic CMS.  Further refinement will depend on client feedback and design specifications.",
