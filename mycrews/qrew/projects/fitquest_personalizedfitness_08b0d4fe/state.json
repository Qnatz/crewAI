Identified Ambiguities/Questions\n\n*   **Ambiguity 1: Personalization Data Depth:** What specific information is required from the user to generate an effective personalized plan? Should we ask about injuries, medical conditions, sleep patterns, or just basic fitness info? How detailed should the 'current fitness level' input be?\n*   **Ambiguity 2: Plan Modification Extent:** How much can users modify the suggested plan? Can they completely rebuild a day, or just swap specific exercises? Are there limits to prevent them from creating an ineffective plan?\n*   **Ambiguity 3: Wearable Integration Scope:** Which specific wearable platforms (Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit API, etc.) should be supported initially? Is this a mandatory feature for the first release, or a potential future enhancement?\n*   **Ambiguity 4: Gamification Mechanics:** What are the specific rules and thresholds for earning points, levels, and badges? Are there leaderboards or social gamification elements planned?\n*   **Ambiguity 5: Real-time Interaction:** Market research mentioned competitor lack of real-time interaction. Does this imply a need for real-time feedback within the app (e.g., live tracking features) or real-time interaction between users (e.g., challenges, social features)?\n*   **Ambiguity 6: Calorie Calculation:** For activities where calories aren't provided by a wearable, should the app calculate them? If so, based on what data (user weight, activity type, duration, intensity)? What formula or method should be used?",
      "architecture_document_markdown": "# FitQuest_PersonalizedFitness - Software Architecture Document\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document details the software architecture for the FitQuest_PersonalizedFitness application, a personalized fitness tracking mobile app incorporating gamification.  The architecture prioritizes scalability, maintainability, and user data privacy, leveraging the team's expertise in Python and React, and deploying on AWS.  A microservices architecture is employed to achieve flexibility and independent scalability of individual components.\n\n## 2.

Technology Stack\n\n*   **Mobile App:** React Native (cross-platform compatibility)\n*   **Backend Services:** Python (Flask framework) -  Microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.  Deployment options include EC2, ECS, or serverless functions (AWS Lambda) depending on service needs.\n*   **API Gateway:** AWS API Gateway (manages API routing, authentication, and authorization)\n*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (RDS on AWS) -  Relational database for structured data.\n*   **Caching:** Redis (AWS ElastiCache) - Improve performance for frequently accessed data.\n*   **Queueing:** SQS (AWS Simple Queue Service) - For asynchronous tasks like reward calculations or data syncing.\n\n## 4. Data Model\n\nThe database will use a relational model (PostgreSQL). Key entities and relationships:\n\n*   **User:**  `user_id (PK), email, password_hash, name, gender, age, height, weight, fitness_level, preferred_activity_types, equipment_available, time_constraints`\n*   **Goal:** `goal_id (PK), user_id (FK), goal_type, target_value, unit, start_date, end_date, status`\n*   **Activity:** `activity_id (PK), user_id (FK), activity_type, start_timestamp, duration, distance, calories_burned, intensity, notes`\n*   **GamificationReward:** `reward_id (PK), reward_type, description, points_required, badge_image_url`\n*   **UserReward:** `user_reward_id (PK), user_id (FK), reward_id (FK), earned_timestamp`\n*   **PersonalizedPlan:** `plan_id (PK), user_id (FK), plan_date, workout_details (JSON)`\n\n\n## 5. API Design Guidelines\n\nRESTful API using JSON for data exchange.  Key endpoints (examples):\n\n*   `/users` (POST - Register, GET - Logged-in User Profile)\n*   `/users/{user_id}/goals` (POST - Create Goal, GET - User's Goals)\n*   `/users/{user_id}/activities` (POST - Log Activity, GET - User's Activities)\n*   `/users/{user_id}/plan` (GET - Get Personalized Plan)\n*   `/gamification/rewards` (GET - Reward Catalog)\n\n\n## 6. Integration Points\n\n*   **Wearable Device Integration:**  Integrate with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit APIs (Ambiguity 3 addressed).  This will be a phased approach, starting with only one platform for the MVP.  Data will be imported and transformed to match the internal `Activity` data model.\n*   **External Services:**  No initial reliance on external services beyond the wearable device integrations.  Consider incorporating third-party services like nutrition databases or exercise libraries later.\n\n\n## 7. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n*   **Security:**  JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.  HTTPS for all communication.  Data encryption at rest and in transit.  Regular security audits and penetration testing.\n*   **Scalability:**  Microservices architecture allows independent scaling of individual services.  AWS services (auto-scaling, load balancing) will be used.  Database will be optimized for performance and scaled as needed (RDS read replicas, sharding). Caching (Redis) will reduce database load.  Asynchronous task processing (SQS) for non-critical operations.\n*   **Performance:**  Caching, database optimization, efficient algorithms, load balancing, and appropriate use of AWS services are critical.  Performance testing throughout development to identify bottlenecks.\n*   **Reliability:**  Redundancy at the infrastructure and application levels.  Monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to failures.  Automated rollbacks for deployments.\n*   **Maintainability:**  Clean code, comprehensive documentation, version control (Git), CI/CD pipeline.  Modular design to make changes easier.\n*   **Usability:**  Following established mobile design patterns in the React Native app.  User testing throughout development.\n\n## 8. Addressing Ambiguities\n\n*   **Ambiguity 1:**  For MVP, collect basic fitness info (age, weight, height, fitness level, preferred activity types).  More detailed information (sleep patterns, medical conditions) could be gathered later.  Fitness level will be a simple categorical input (beginner, intermediate, advanced).\n*   **Ambiguity 2:**  Initially, allow users to swap exercises within a suggested plan, but prevent complete restructuring. More sophisticated modification capabilities can be added later.\n*   **Ambiguity 3:**  Apple HealthKit initially, with Google Fit as a future enhancement.\n*   **Ambiguity 4:**  The specific gamification mechanics (points, levels, badges) will be defined in a separate document detailing the game design.  Leaderboards will be addressed in a future iteration.\n*   **Ambiguity 5:** Real-time interaction will not be part of the MVP.  This can be considered for future versions if required.\n*   **Ambiguity 6:**  For the MVP, manual calorie input is sufficient.  Future versions could incorporate a calorie estimation algorithm using readily available data, potentially using a third-party API.\n\n\nThis architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable, and secure fitness application.  Continuous iteration and monitoring will be crucial to adapt and improve the architecture as the application grows and user needs evolve.",
