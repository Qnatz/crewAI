      "architecture_document_markdown": "# NourishChildWebsite - Software Architecture Document\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the software architecture for the NourishChildWebsite, a web-only platform designed to support the mission of an NGO combating child malnutrition.  The architecture prioritizes scalability, maintainability, security, and accessibility.\n\n**2. High-Level System Diagram**\n\n```\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n| Web Browser     | <--> | Web Server      | <--> | Database Server |\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n       ^                                         |\n       |                                         |\n       +------------------------------------------+\n                                      |\n                                      v\n                               +-----------------+\n                               | Content Management System (CMS) |\n                               +-----------------+\n                                      |\n                                      v\n                               +-----------------+\n                               | Payment Gateway  |\n                               +-----------------+\n\n```\n\n**3. Technology Stack**\n\n* **Frontend:** React.js (for a dynamic and responsive user interface), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.  Consideration will be given to using a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent styling.\n* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (for a lightweight and scalable server-side framework).\n* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for its robustness, scalability, and support for complex data relationships).\n* **CMS:** Strapi (headless CMS for flexible content management and API-driven content delivery).  Alternatively, a simpler CMS like WordPress could be considered if there is a strong preference for ease of use by non-technical users.\n* **Payment Gateway:** Stripe (for secure and reliable online payment processing).  Other options like PayPal can be considered based on specific requirements and regional availability.\n* **Cloud Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  The choice depends on cost-effectiveness and existing infrastructure.\n\n**Justification for Technology Stack:**\n\n* **React.js:** Provides a component-based architecture for efficient development and maintenance of the frontend.  Its large community and extensive ecosystem ensure easy integration with other tools and libraries.\n* **Node.js/Express.js:** Offer a fast and efficient server-side environment, ideal for handling web requests and API calls.\n* **PostgreSQL:** A robust and scalable relational database, well-suited for managing the website's data.\n* **Strapi:**  Provides a powerful and flexible headless CMS, allowing for complete decoupling of the frontend and backend, enabling easier content updates and future scalability.\n* **Stripe:** A secure and widely adopted payment gateway with a comprehensive API for easy integration.\n* **Cloud Provider:** Cloud platforms offer scalability, reliability, and security features that are crucial for a production website.\n\n\n**4. Data Model Design**\n\nThe database will include tables for:\n\n* **Users:** (user_id, username, password, role, email)\n* **Pages:** (page_id, title, content, language, slug)\n* **Programs:** (program_id, title, description, image, language)\n* **Donations:** (donation_id, user_id, amount, payment_status, timestamp)\n* **Volunteers:** (volunteer_id, name, email, phone, application_status)\n* **ContactUs:** (contact_id, name, email, message)\n\nRelationships between tables will be established using foreign keys to maintain data integrity.\n\n**5. API Design Guidelines and Key Endpoint Definitions**\n\nThe API will follow RESTful principles.  Key endpoints include:\n\n* **GET /pages:** Retrieves all pages or a specific page by ID/slug.\n* **GET /programs:** Retrieves all programs or a specific program by ID.\n* **POST /donations:** Processes a new donation.\n* **POST /volunteers:** Submits a volunteer application.\n* **POST /contact:** Submits a contact form message.\n\nEach endpoint will have appropriate request and response structures defined using JSON.\n\n**6. Integration Points with External Services**\n\n* **Payment Gateway (Stripe):** Integration for secure online donation processing.\n* **Email Service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun):**  For sending donation confirmations, volunteer application updates, and contact form responses.\n* **Translation Service (Optional):** For supporting multilingual content.\n\n**7. Considerations for Non-Functional Requirements**\n\n* **Security:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, input validation, and secure coding practices to protect against vulnerabilities.  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted.  Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) will be ensured.\n* **Scalability:** The architecture is designed for scalability using cloud-based infrastructure, horizontal scaling of server instances, and efficient database design.  Load balancing and caching mechanisms will be implemented to handle peak traffic.\n* **Performance:** Optimize database queries, use efficient caching strategies, and employ code optimization techniques to ensure fast loading times and responsive user interactions.  Performance monitoring and testing will be integral parts of the development process.\n* **Usability:**  The website will follow usability best practices, including clear navigation, intuitive design, and accessible content.  Usability testing will be conducted throughout the development process.\n* **Accessibility:**  The website will adhere to WCAG guidelines to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.  This includes using appropriate ARIA attributes, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring keyboard navigation.\n* **Maintainability:** The modular architecture and use of well-documented code will make the website easy to maintain and update.  Version control (Git) will be used to track changes and facilitate collaboration.\n\n**8. Deployment Diagram**\n\nThe website will be deployed on a cloud platform (AWS or GCP) using a containerization technology like Docker and orchestration tools such as Kubernetes for efficient management and scaling.  A CI/CD pipeline will automate the build, testing, and deployment process.\n\n\nThis architecture provides a solid foundation for building a robust, scalable, and maintainable website for NourishChild.  Further details will be elaborated during the design and implementation phases.",
