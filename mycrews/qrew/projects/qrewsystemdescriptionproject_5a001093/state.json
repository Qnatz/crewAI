Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the software architecture for the QrewSystem documentation project. Given the \"documentation-only\" scope, the architecture focuses on the structure, tools, and processes for creating, managing, and delivering comprehensive documentation for the QrewSystem. It addresses the user stories, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements specified in the Technical Requirements Specification Document.\n\n## 2. Goals\n\nThe primary goal is to create a documentation system that is clear, concise, comprehensive, easily searchable, navigable, and accessible to end-users, administrators, and developers.\n\n## 3. High-Level System Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Source Material (Markdown Files)] --> B(Documentation Generator);\n    B --> C{Output Formats (HTML, PDF)};\n    C --> D[Web Server/Hosting Platform];\n    D --> E((End-Users, Administrators, Developers));\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n```\n\n**Description:**\n\n1.  **Source Material (Markdown Files):** The documentation content is written in Markdown format. This allows for easy writing, version control, and conversion to various output formats.\n2.  **Documentation Generator:** A static site generator or documentation tool processes the Markdown files and generates HTML and PDF versions of the documentation.\n3.  **Output Formats (HTML, PDF):** The generated documentation is available in HTML for online viewing and PDF for offline access and printing.\n4.  **Web Server/Hosting Platform:** The HTML documentation is hosted on a web server, making it accessible to users via a web browser.  The PDF documentation is available for download from this platform.\n5.  **End-Users, Administrators, Developers:** The target audience accesses the documentation through the web server or by downloading the PDF files.\n\n## 4. Technology Stack\n\n*   **Documentation Source Format:** Markdown (.md)\n*   **Documentation Generator:**\n    *   **Option 1: MkDocs**\n        *   *Description:* A fast, simple static site generator geared towards building project documentation. It reads Markdown source files and creates a fully navigable HTML site.\n        *   *Justification:* Easy to set up, uses Markdown, supports themes and plugins, and generates static HTML.\n    *   **Option 2: Sphinx**\n        *   *Description:* A powerful documentation generator, especially well-suited for technical documentation.

More complex configuration than MkDocs but offers greater flexibility.\n    *   **Option 3: Docusaurus**\n        *   *Description:* A static site generator by Facebook, optimized for documentation websites. Supports Markdown and React components.\n        *   *Justification:* Good for documentation with interactive components or a blog. Provides a modern look and feel and excellent plugin support.\n*   **Theme/Templates:** Theme included with the chosen documentation generator, customized as needed using HTML/CSS.\n*   **Version Control:** Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)\n    *   *Justification:* To track changes to the documentation source files, enable collaboration, and maintain a history of revisions.\n*   **Hosting:**\n    *   **Option 1: GitHub Pages**\n        *   *Description:* Free hosting directly from a GitHub repository.\n        *   *Justification:* Simple, free, and integrates seamlessly with Git version control.  Good for public documentation.\n    *   **Option 2: GitLab Pages**\n        *   *Description:* Free hosting directly from a GitLab repository.\n        *   *Justification:* Similar to GitHub Pages, ideal if using GitLab for version control.\n    *   **Option 3: Netlify**\n        *   *Description:* A platform for deploying static sites.\n        *   *Justification:* Easy deployment, continuous integration, and other features for managing static sites.\n    *   **Option 4: AWS S3 + CloudFront**\n        *   *Description:* Scalable and cost-effective cloud storage and content delivery network.\n        *   *Justification:* Suitable for high-traffic documentation websites requiring global distribution and high availability.\n*   **Search:**\n    *   **Option 1: Built-in Search (if provided by the documentation generator)**\n    *   **Option 2: Algolia (for more advanced search capabilities)**\n        *   *Justification:* Provides fast and relevant search results with features like typo tolerance and faceting.\n*   **PDF Generation:** Included with the chosen documentation generator (e.g., using a plugin or built-in functionality).\n\n**Chosen Stack (Example):**\n\nBased on simplicity and ease of use for a general documentation project, the following stack is selected for the purposes of this document:\n\n*   **Documentation Source Format:** Markdown (.md)\n*   **Documentation Generator:** MkDocs\n*   **Theme/Templates:** Material for MkDocs\n*   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub)\n*   **Hosting:** GitHub Pages\n*   **Search:**  MkDocs built-in search (initially), with the potential to migrate to Algolia if more advanced search is required.\n\n## 5. Data Model Design Overview\n\nSince the project scope is documentation-only, there is no traditional database or data model in the sense of a software application. The \"data\" is primarily the content of the documentation itself, structured as follows:\n\n*   **Documentation Pages:**\n    *   Filename (e.g., `introduction.md`, `api-reference.md`)\n    *   Title\n    *   Content (Markdown text)\n    *   Metadata (e.g., author, last updated date, tags)\n*   **Table of Contents:**\n    *   Hierarchical structure representing the organization of the documentation.  Typically defined in a `mkdocs.yml` or similar configuration file.\n    *   Links to corresponding documentation pages.\n*   **Assets:**\n    *   Images (e.g., diagrams, screenshots)\n    *   Code examples\n    *   PDF files\n\n## 6. API Design Guidelines and Key Endpoint Definitions\n\nN/A - This is a documentation-only project. No APIs are exposed. The documentation is served as static HTML and downloadable PDFs.\n\n## 7. Integration Points with Any External Services\n\n*   **Version Control System (Git):** Integration with GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) for version control and collaboration.\n*   **Search Service (Algolia - Optional):** Integration with Algolia for enhanced search functionality (if chosen).\n*   **Analytics (Optional):** Integration with Google Analytics or similar for tracking documentation usage and identifying areas for improvement.\n\n## 8. Considerations for Non-Functional Requirements\n\n*   **Accessibility:**\n    *   Use semantic HTML in the generated documentation.\n    *   Provide alternative text for images.\n    *   Ensure sufficient color contrast.\n    *   Test the documentation with accessibility tools (e.g., WAVE, Axe).\n    *   Aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.\n*   **Performance:**\n    *   Optimize images for web delivery.\n    *   Use a CDN for hosting the documentation to ensure fast loading times globally.\n    *   Minimize the use of large JavaScript files.\n*   **Maintainability:**\n    *   Use a consistent style and tone throughout the documentation.\n    *   Keep the documentation structure organized and easy to navigate.\n    *   Use clear and concise language.\n    *   Regularly review and update the documentation.\n*   **Readability:**\n    *   Use headings, subheadings, and lists to break up the text.\n    *   Use visuals (e.g., diagrams, screenshots) to illustrate complex concepts.\n    *   Define technical terms in a glossary.\n*   **Consistency:**\n    *   Establish a style guide for writing the documentation.\n    *   Use consistent terminology and formatting.\n    *   Review the documentation regularly to ensure consistency.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Ensure the hosting platform is secure.\n    *   Protect the documentation source files from unauthorized access.\n    *   Consider using HTTPS to encrypt traffic to the documentation website.\n    *   If using Algolia, ensure proper API key management.\n*   **Scalability:**\n    *   The static site architecture is inherently scalable.\n    *   Using a CDN ensures that the documentation can handle a large number of requests.\n\n## 9. Glossary of Terms\n\n*   **QrewSystem:** A platform for managing project workflows and team collaboration.\n*   **Markdown:** A lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text.\n*   **MkDocs:** A static site generator geared towards building project documentation.\n*   **HTML:** HyperText Markup Language, the standard markup language for creating web pages.\n*   **PDF:** Portable Document Format, a file format for representing documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.\n*   **CDN:** Content Delivery Network, a geographically distributed network of servers that cache content to improve performance.\n*   **WCAG:** Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, a set of guidelines for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities.\n\n## 10. Identified Ambiguities/Questions (Revisited)\n\nThe following questions from the original Technical Requirements Specification Document need to be addressed during the implementation phase:\n\n*   **What specific features and functionalities of the QrewSystem should be prioritized in the documentation?** *This requires a meeting with stakeholders to identify the most important features for each target audience.*\n*   **Are there any existing style guides or branding guidelines that should be followed?** *The documentation should adhere to any existing style guides to ensure consistency with other QrewSystem materials.*\n*   **What is the expected level of technical detail for each target audience?** *The documentation should be tailored to the technical expertise of each audience. End-users may require less technical detail than developers.*\n*   **Where will the documentation be hosted (e.g., internal wiki, public website)?** *GitHub Pages is specified in this document, but the final hosting location should be confirmed with stakeholders.*\n*   **What is the process for updating the documentation as the QrewSystem evolves?** *A clear process for updating the documentation should be established, including who is responsible for making updates and how changes are reviewed and approved.*\n*   **Are there specific WCAG compliance levels that need to be met?** *WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance is suggested, but the specific compliance level should be confirmed with stakeholders.*\n```",
