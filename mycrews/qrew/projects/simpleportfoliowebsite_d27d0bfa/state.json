      "requirements_document_markdown": "# Technical Requirements Specification: SimplePortfolioWebsite\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the technical requirements for the SimplePortfolioWebsite project. The goal is to develop a single-page, responsive personal portfolio website with a clean and modern design, showcasing the owner's identity, an 'About Me' section, and a selection of projects.\n\n## 2. User Stories\n\nAs a visitor, I want to see a navigation bar so I can easily jump to different sections of the website.\n*   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    *   The navigation bar is visible at the top of the page.\n    *   Clicking a navigation link scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section (e.g., About, Projects).\n    *   The navigation remains functional on different screen sizes.\n\nAs a visitor, I want to see the owner's name and title clearly displayed in a header section so I know who the portfolio belongs to.\n*   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    *   A prominent header section is present at the top of the page below the navigation.\n    *   The header displays the owner's full name and professional title.\n\nAs a visitor, I want to read an 'About Me' section so I can learn more about the portfolio owner's background and skills.\n*   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    *   A dedicated section titled 'About Me' is present on the page.\n    *   This section contains descriptive text about the owner.\n\nAs a visitor, I want to view a 'Projects' section showcasing 2-3 projects so I can see examples of the owner's work.\n*   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    *   A dedicated section titled 'Projects' is present on the page.\n    *   This section displays exactly 2 or 3 individual project entries.\n\nAs a visitor, for each project in the 'Projects' section, I want to see a title, a short description, and an image placeholder so I can get a basic understanding of the project.\n*   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    *   Each project entry clearly displays a title.\n    *   Each project entry includes a brief descriptive text summary.\n    *   Each project entry includes a visual placeholder (e.g., a grey box, placeholder image).\n\nAs a visitor, I want the website to be mobile-responsive so I can view and interact with it comfortably on different devices (phones, tablets, desktops).\n*   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    *   The layout adjusts automatically and gracefully to screen sizes ranging from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.\n    *   All content remains accessible and readable on all supported screen sizes.\n    *   Navigation remains functional and usable on all screen sizes (e.g., potentially using a collapsed/hamburger menu on small screens).\n\nAs a visitor, I want the website to load quickly so I don't have to wait long to see the content.\n*   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    *   The initial page load time is minimal (e.g., under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection, aiming lower if possible).\n    *   Website assets (images, CSS, etc.) are optimized for fast delivery.\n\nAs a developer/owner, I want it to be easy to add or update project details in the future.\n*   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    *   The structure for project content is clear and simple.\n    *   Updating project details (title, description, image placeholder) does not require complex coding or tooling.\n\nAs a visitor, I want to see a copyright notice in the footer.\n*   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n    *   A footer section is present at the bottom of the page.\n    *   The footer contains a copyright symbol and the current year.\n\n## 3. Functional Requirements\n\n*   **FR1:** Display a static navigation bar at the top of the viewport.\n*   **FR2:** Implement smooth scrolling functionality for navigation links to respective page sections.\n*   **FR3:** Display a header section containing the owner's name and title.\n*   **FR4:** Display an 'About Me' section with placeholder text content.\n*   **FR5:** Display a 'Projects' section containing 2 to 3 distinct project entries.\n*   **FR6:** Each project entry shall display a title (text).\n*   **FR7:** Each project entry shall display a short description (text).\n*   **FR8:** Each project entry shall display an image placeholder (e.g., an `<img>` tag pointing to a placeholder asset or a styled `<div>`).\n*   **FR9:** Display a footer section containing copyright information (e.g., \u00a9 [Year]).\n\n## 4. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n*   **NFR1: Responsiveness:** The website must implement a responsive design, adapting layout and content display for optimal viewing across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) with screen widths ranging typically from 320px upwards.\n*   **NFR2: Performance:** The website must load quickly. Assets should be optimized (e.g., image compression, minified CSS/JS) to minimize load times.\n*   **NFR3: Maintainability:** The content, particularly project details, should be easily editable. The method should not require significant technical expertise beyond basic text/file editing.\n*   **NFR4: Browser Compatibility:** The website should render correctly and be fully functional on the latest stable versions of major web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.\n*   **NFR5: Accessibility:** Basic accessibility considerations (e.g., semantic HTML, alt text for images/placeholders where appropriate) should be applied.\n*   **NFR6: Security:** As a static site, security concerns are minimal on the client side. Server-side security is dependent on the hosting environment but is not within the scope of the website code itself for this static implementation.\n\n## 5. Data Requirements\n\n*   **Input Data:**\n    *   Owner's Full Name (string)\n    *   Owner's Title (string)\n    *   'About Me' Text Content (string, potentially multi-paragraph)\n    *   For each Project (2-3 entries):\n        *   Project Title (string)\n        *   Project Short Description (string)\n        *   Image Placeholder Source/Identifier (e.g., file path to a placeholder image, or indicator for CSS styling)\n    *   Copyright Year (integer/string)\n*   **Storage:** Data will primarily be embedded directly within static HTML, CSS, and potentially minimal JavaScript files. An alternative for project data could be a simple data file format (like JSON) read by a script for easier updating, depending on the resolution of the ambiguity below.\n*   **Output:** Rendered HTML, CSS, and images/placeholders displayed in the user's web browser.\n\n## 6. Glossary of Terms\n\n*   **Single-page website:** A website structure where all content resides on a single HTML page, and navigation typically scrolls the user to different sections of that page rather than loading new pages.\n*   **Responsive Design:** A web design approach that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes by using flexible layouts, fluid images, and CSS media queries.\n*   **Image Placeholder:** A temporary visual element (like a solid color box, a generic icon, or a placeholder image file) used to indicate where an actual image will eventually be placed.\n\n## 7. Identified Ambiguities/Questions\n\n*   **Content Update Mechanism:** The requirement for project details to be \"easy to add or update\" is vague. Does this imply direct editing of HTML files, editing of a simple data file (like JSON) read by a script, or is a simple static site generator (like Jekyll, Hugo, etc.) considered for easier templating and content management?\n*   **Image Placeholders:** Should the image placeholders be generic (e.g., a simple grey box via CSS) or should they be specific placeholder image files? Are there any size or aspect ratio requirements for these placeholders?\n*   **Design Specifics:** Beyond \"clean and modern,\" are there any specific design guidelines, color palettes, typography choices, or layout preferences?\n*   **'About Me' Content:** What specific information should be included in the 'About Me' section (e.g., skills list, professional summary, education, interests)?\n*   **Navigation Bar Details:** Should the navigation bar be fixed at the top as the user scrolls?\n\nThese ambiguities should be clarified with stakeholders to ensure the development meets expectations.",
      "architecture_document_markdown": "# SimplePortfolioWebsite: Software Architecture Document\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the software architecture for the `SimplePortfolioWebsite` project.  The website is a single-page, responsive portfolio showcasing the owner's information and projects.  The architecture prioritizes simplicity, maintainability, and performance, adhering to the constraint of using only HTML, CSS, and minimal vanilla JavaScript, deployable as static files.\n\n\n## 2. High-Level System Diagram\n\nThe system consists of a single, self-contained HTML file that incorporates all website content.  No external services or APIs are involved.\n\n```\n+-----------------+\n|  Client Browser |\n+-----------------+\n     |\n     | HTTP Request\n     V\n+-----------------+\n| Static HTML File|\n+-----------------+\n     |  (includes CSS & JS)\n     |\n+-----------------+\n|  Web Server     | (e.g., Nginx, Apache)\n+-----------------+\n```\n\n**Component Diagram:**\n\nThe website's components are largely integrated within the single HTML file:\n\n```\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n|   Header        |---->| Navigation Bar  |---->|  Main Content   |\n+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+\n     ^                                                    |\n     |                                                    |\n     +-----------------------------------------------------+\n                                                         |\n                                                         V\n                                                +-----------------+\n                                                |      Footer      |\n                                                +-----------------+\n```\n\n**Deployment Diagram:**\n\nThe website will be deployed as static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) on a web server.\n\n```\n+-----------------+\n| Web Server      |  (e.g., AWS S3, Netlify, GitHub Pages)\n+-----------------+\n     |\n     | HTTP\n     V\n+-----------------+\n|  Client Browser |\n+-----------------+\n```\n\n\n## 3. Technology Stack\n\n*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (minimal for smooth scrolling)\n*   **Markup:** Semantic HTML5 for structure and accessibility.\n*   **Styling:** CSS for responsive design and visual presentation.  A CSS preprocessor (like Sass or Less) could be considered for larger projects to improve maintainability.\n*   **Scripting:**  Vanilla JavaScript will be used solely for implementing smooth scrolling functionality for the navigation links.\n*   **Deployment:** Any static website hosting service (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, Vercel).\n\n\n## 4. Data Model\n\nThe data is statically embedded within the HTML file.  To facilitate easier updates, project data can be stored in a separate JSON file that is read and injected into the HTML using a small JavaScript function during page load.\n\n\n**Data Structure (JSON Example for Projects):**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Project 1\",\n    \"description\": \"Short description of Project 1.\",\n    \"image\": \"project1.jpg\" // Or a placeholder class\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Project 2\",\n    \"description\": \"Short description of Project 2.\",\n    \"image\": \"project2.jpg\" // Or a placeholder class\n  }\n]\n```\n\n\n## 5. API Design (N/A)\n\nNo APIs are required for this project as it's a static website.\n\n\n## 6. Integration Points (N/A)\n\nNo external services or integrations are planned.\n\n\n## 7. Non-Functional Requirements Considerations\n\n*   **Responsiveness (NFR1):** Achieved using CSS media queries and flexible layouts.\n*   **Performance (NFR2):** Optimized images, minified CSS/JS (if any JS is used beyond smooth scrolling), efficient HTML structure.  Lazy loading for images could be considered for further optimization.\n*   **Maintainability (NFR3):** Clear HTML structure, well-organized CSS, and potentially a separate JSON file for project data to simplify updates.\n*   **Browser Compatibility (NFR4):**  Use of modern but widely supported HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features. Thorough browser testing is essential.\n*   **Accessibility (NFR5):** Semantic HTML (e.g., using appropriate headings, labels, and ARIA attributes where needed), alt text for images.\n*   **Security (NFR6):** Minimal security concerns for a static site; security relies on the hosting provider's infrastructure.  Content Security Policy (CSP) headers can be used on the server to enhance security.\n\n## 8.  Ambiguity Resolutions\n\n*   **Content Update Mechanism:** A JSON file for project data, read by a small JavaScript script on page load, will be used. This allows easy updates without modifying the core HTML structure.\n*   **Image Placeholders:** Generic grey boxes using CSS will be used as image placeholders for simplicity and consistency.\n*   **Design Specifics:**  A clean and modern design will be implemented, using a consistent color palette and typography.  Detailed design specifications will be created collaboratively with the client.\n*   **'About Me' Content:**  The content will include a brief professional summary, key skills, and possibly links to relevant social media profiles or other online presence (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).\n*   **Navigation Bar Details:** The navigation bar will be fixed at the top of the viewport during scrolling.\n\n\nThis architecture provides a solid foundation for a simple, maintainable, and performant portfolio website.  The use of static files ensures easy deployment and minimal operational overhead. The flexibility of the JSON-based project data management allows for simple updates without significant technical expertise.",
