      "architecture_document_markdown": "# TemplateShowcaseWebsite - Software Architecture Document\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the software architecture for the `TemplateShowcaseWebsite`, a single-page web application designed to showcase and sell web templates.  The architecture prioritizes scalability, maintainability, and security.  The design focuses on a serverless backend to minimize operational overhead.\n\n## 2. High-Level System Diagram\n\n```plantuml\n@startuml\n!include <c4/C4_Context>\n!include <c4/C4_Container>\n!include <c4/C4_Component>\n\nSystem_Boundary(c1, \"TemplateShowcaseWebsite\") {\n  Person(customer, \"Customer\", \"Browses and purchases templates\")\n  Person(admin, \"Administrator\", \"Manages templates\")\n\n  Container(website, \"Website Frontend\", \"React\", \"Single-page application displaying templates\")\n  ContainerDb(database, \"Template Database\", \"DynamoDB\", \"Stores template information\")\n  Container(api, \"API Gateway\", \"AWS API Gateway\", \"Handles requests from the frontend\")\n  Container(paymentGateway, \"Payment Gateway\", \"Stripe\", \"Processes payments\")\n\n  Rel(customer, website, \"Browses templates\", \"HTTP\")\n  Rel(admin, api, \"Manages templates\", \"HTTPS\")\n  Rel(website, api, \"Fetches template data\", \"REST\")\n  Rel(api, database, \"Accesses template data\", \"REST\")\n  Rel(api, paymentGateway, \"Processes payments\", \"HTTPS\")\n}\n@enduml\n```\n\n## 3. Technology Stack\n\n* **Frontend:** React with a suitable CSS framework (e.g., Material UI, Tailwind CSS) for a responsive and visually appealing user interface.\n* **Backend:** Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda functions for API endpoints and DynamoDB for data storage.  This eliminates the need for managing servers.\n* **Database:** DynamoDB (NoSQL) for its scalability and flexibility in handling template data.\n* **API Gateway:** AWS API Gateway for routing and managing API requests.\n* **Payment Gateway:** Stripe for secure payment processing.\n* **Deployment:** AWS Amplify or similar service for easy deployment and hosting.\n\n\n## 4. Data Model\n\nThe core data entity is `Template`.  The schema might include:\n\n* `templateId` (string, primary key): Unique identifier for each template.\n* `title` (string): Template title.\n* `description` (string): Detailed description of the template.\n* `price` (number): Price of the template.\n* `imageUrl` (string): URL of the template preview image.\n* `features` (array of strings): List of template features.\n* `compatibility` (string): Compatibility information (e.g., browsers, CMS).\n* `reviews` (array of objects): Customer reviews (optional).\n\n\n## 5. API Design\n\nThe API will use RESTful principles. Key endpoints include:\n\n* **GET /templates:** Retrieves a list of available templates.  Response: `[Template]`\n* **GET /templates/{templateId}:** Retrieves details for a specific template. Response: `Template`\n* **POST /templates:** (Admin only) Creates a new template. Request: `Template`  Response: `Template`\n* **PUT /templates/{templateId}:** (Admin only) Updates an existing template. Request: `Template` Response: `Template`\n* **DELETE /templates/{templateId}:** (Admin only) Deletes a template. Response: `{}`\n* **POST /checkout:** Initiates a payment with Stripe. Request: `{ templateId, customerId }` Response: `{ paymentIntent }`\n\n\n## 6. Integration Points\n\n* **Stripe:** Integrated for secure online payments.  The API will handle communication with the Stripe API.\n* **AWS Services:**  Integration with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.\n\n\n## 7. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n* **Performance:**  Caching mechanisms (e.g., CDN for static assets, API Gateway caching) will be implemented to optimize performance.  Database indexing will be optimized for fast query times.\n* **Security:**  HTTPS will be enforced throughout the application.  Input validation and sanitization will be implemented to prevent injection attacks.  Stripe's secure payment processing will handle sensitive payment information.  Admin access will be protected with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth).\n* **Scalability:** The serverless architecture of AWS Lambda and DynamoDB naturally scales to handle increased traffic and data volume.\n* **Usability:**  The frontend will be designed with usability best practices in mind, ensuring intuitive navigation and a clear user experience.\n* **Accessibility:**  The website will adhere to WCAG guidelines for accessibility.\n\n\n## 8.  Admin Panel\n\nA simple admin panel will be created, possibly integrated directly into the single-page application behind authentication, allowing for CRUD operations on templates.  Authentication could be handled via a secure API endpoint.\n\n## 9.  Ambiguity Clarifications\n\nThe architecture assumes the following, based on the ambiguities:\n\n* **Payment Gateway:** Stripe will be used.\n* **Search Functionality:**  Initially, search functionality is omitted for MVP.  It can be added later.\n* **Shopping Cart:**  Single-template purchases are prioritized for MVP. A shopping cart could be added in future iterations.\n* **Admin Panel:** A basic admin panel for managing templates will be implemented.\n* **Hosting and Deployment:** AWS Amplify is recommended for its ease of use and serverless integration.\n* **Design and Branding:**  Design and branding details will be handled separately.\n* **Content Management:** Templates will be managed via the Admin Panel.\n\n\nThis architecture provides a solid foundation for the `TemplateShowcaseWebsite`.  Further details can be added as the project progresses.",
