Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the software architecture for the MockSocialPlatformArchFix project, a full-stack social media platform. It details the system's components, technologies, data model, APIs, and key considerations for non-functional requirements.\n\n## 2. Architecture Overview\n\nThe architecture follows a microservices-inspired approach with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend (web and mobile), backend services, and data storage. This allows for independent scaling, deployment, and maintenance of individual components. The system adopts a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.\n\n## 3.

Integration Points\n\n*   **Object Storage (AWS S3):** Post Service integrates with S3 to store and retrieve images and videos.\n*   **Push Notification Service (FCM/APNs):** Notification Service integrates with FCM/APNs to send push notifications to mobile devices.\n*   **Email Service (SendGrid/AWS SES):** Authentication Service integrates with SendGrid/SES to send verification emails and password reset emails.\n\n## 8. Non-Functional Requirements Considerations\n\n### 8.1. Security\n\n*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Use JWT for authentication and role-based access control.\n*   **Password Storage:** Store passwords using bcrypt hashing.\n*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS).\n*   **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.\n*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.\n*   **CORS:** Configure CORS properly to restrict cross-origin requests.\n\n### 8.2. Scalability\n\n*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Design the system to be horizontally scalable by deploying multiple instances of each service behind a load balancer.\n*   **Database Sharding:** Implement database sharding to distribute data across multiple database servers.\n*   **Caching:** Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load.\n*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous tasks (e.g., sending notifications, processing images).\n*   **CDN:** Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static assets (e.g., images, videos) closer to users.\n\n### 8.3. Performance\n\n*   **Optimize Database Queries:** Optimize database queries to minimize response times.\n*   **Caching:** Use caching to reduce database load and improve response times.\n*   **Code Optimization:** Optimize code for performance.\n*   **Load Testing:** Conduct regular load testing to identify and address performance bottlenecks.\n*   **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools to track system performance and identify issues.\n*   **Gzip Compression:** Enable Gzip compression for API responses.\n\n### 8.4. Reliability\n\n*   **High Availability:** Deploy multiple instances of each service across multiple availability zones.\n*   **Redundancy:** Implement redundancy for critical components (e.g., databases, load balancers).\n*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to failures.\n*   **Backups:** Implement regular backups of databases and other critical data.\n*   **Disaster Recovery:** Develop a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in the event of a major outage.\n\n### 8.5. Usability\n\n*   **Intuitive User Interface:** Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface.\n*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to ensure usability for users with disabilities.\n*   **Responsive Design:** Implement responsive design to ensure the application works well on different devices.\n\n## 9. Ambiguity Resolutions and Assumptions\n\nAddressing the ambiguities identified in the original specification:\n\n*   **Mobile Platform specifics**: Both iOS and Android are supported through React Native. UI/UX will adhere to platform-specific guidelines (Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS) using platform-specific components where necessary within React Native.\n*   **Content Moderation:** Content moderation policies will need to be defined. A reporting mechanism for inappropriate content will be implemented, triggering manual review by moderators. This can be integrated as a service later.\n*   **Push Notifications:** Push notifications will be implemented using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and Apple Push Notification service (APNs) for iOS.\n*   **Monetization**: Monetization features are out of scope for the initial architecture. Future iterations can incorporate ad integration or subscription models with minimal disruption due to the service-oriented architecture.\n\n## 10. Conclusion\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the software architecture for the MockSocialPlatformArchFix project. By following this architecture, the project can be developed in a scalable, secure, and reliable manner. Continuous monitoring, testing, and refinement will be crucial to ensure the long-term success of the platform.\n```",
