  - description: >
      Analyze the provided {project_requirements}, {existing_architecture_details} (if any),
      {team_skills}, and {budget_constraints} to propose an optimal technology stack.
      Research and compare suitable frameworks, languages, databases, and tools.
      The recommendation should cover frontend, backend, database, and deployment considerations.
    expected_output: >
      A detailed technology stack proposal document. This document should include:
      - Recommended technologies for each layer (e.g., frontend, backend, data storage).
      - Justification for each recommendation, including pros and cons.
      - Comparison with alternative technologies.
      - Potential risks and mitigation strategies associated with the proposed stack.
      - How the stack aligns with team skills and project constraints.

  - description: >
      Evaluate the suitability of '{specific_technology_name}' for the '{project_context}' project.
      Consider its maturity, community support, scalability, security implications, and integration capabilities
      with the existing or planned {existing_stack_components}.
    expected_output: >
      An evaluation report for '{specific_technology_name}' in the context of '{project_context}'.
      The report should include:
      - A clear recommendation (adopt, consider alternatives, reject).
      - Detailed reasoning based on evaluation criteria.
      - Potential benefits and drawbacks of adopting the technology.

  - description: >
      Prepare a presentation summarizing the recommended technology stack for the upcoming '{project_name}' project.
      The presentation should be targeted at both technical and non-technical stakeholders,
      clearly explaining the choices and their benefits.
      Input: {tech_stack_proposal_document}.
    expected_output: >
      A presentation file (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Markdown slides).
      The presentation should be well-structured, visually appealing, and effectively communicate
      the key aspects of the technology stack recommendation.
