      Analyze the high-level {user_idea} and any accompanying {stakeholder_feedback} or {market_research_data}.
      To ensure consistency and leverage existing knowledge, consult the Knowledge Base for any relevant past projects, architectural decisions, or definitions related to the core concepts in the {user_idea}.
      Elicit further details if necessary and transform this information into a structured set of technical requirements.
      Focus on clarity, testability, and completeness.
    expected_output: >
      A comprehensive technical requirements specification document. This document should include:
      - Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria.
      - Functional requirements (what the system should do).
      - Non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security, usability).
      - Data requirements (input/output data, data formats).
      - A glossary of terms if new concepts are introduced.
      - Any identified ambiguities or areas needing further clarification.
