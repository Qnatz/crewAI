  - description: >
      Analyze the incoming {user_request} or {project_goal_statement} using available tools, including the Knowledge Base Query Tool, for relevant context or existing project information.
      Clarify ambiguities and define the primary objectives, scope, and desired outcomes.
      Consult with the IdeaInterpreterAgent if the request is vague or needs significant refinement even after knowledge base consultation.
      Input: {user_request}, {project_goal_statement}, {priority_level}.
    expected_output: >
      A JSON object adhering to the following schema:
      {
        "project_name": "string (unique and descriptive, or existing project name if identified)",
        "refined_brief": "string (a concise summary of the project's purpose and key objectives)",
        "is_new_project": "boolean (true if the request is for a new project, false otherwise)",
        "recommended_next_stage": "string (e.g., 'architecture', 'execution', 'clarification')",
        "project_scope": "string (e.g., 'web-only', 'mobile-only', 'full-stack', 'unknown')",
        "key_deliverables": ["string (list of key deliverables)"],
        "success_criteria": ["string (list of success criteria)"],
        "initial_complexity_assessment": "string (e.g., 'low', 'medium', 'high')",
        "potential_challenges": ["string (list of potential challenges, can be empty)"]
      }
      Ensure all string values within the JSON are properly escaped.
      The output MUST be only the JSON object itself, without any surrounding text or markdown code fences.

  - description: > # This task remains unchanged
      Based on the clarified project brief for {project_name}, determine the overall execution strategy.
      This involves deciding whether to first engage the ProjectArchitectAgent for design,
      the TechVettingCouncilAgent for technology choices, or directly the ExecutionManagerAgent for well-defined projects.
      Delegate the initial phase to the chosen orchestrator or lead agent.
      Input: {project_brief_document_url}, {organizational_priorities}.
    expected_output: >
      A high-level project initiation plan, specifying:
      - The first orchestrator or Lead Agent to be engaged.
      - The initial set of inputs and objectives for this first engagement.
      - A record of the delegation.
    agent: taskmaster_agent

  - description: > # This task remains unchanged
      Track the handoff of the {project_name} to the designated orchestrator or Lead Agent.
      Ensure they have acknowledged receipt and have all necessary information to proceed.
      Log the initial delegation and set up a mechanism for receiving high-level status updates or completion notifications.
      Input: {project_name}, {delegated_agent_or_crew_name}, {handoff_confirmation_process}.
    expected_output: >
      Confirmation of successful handoff of {project_name}.
      Initial project state logged in a tracking system (conceptual).
      High-level monitoring plan established.
