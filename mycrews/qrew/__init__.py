# This __init__.py is kept minimal to avoid circular imports.
# Submodules should be imported directly, e.g.,
# from mycrews.qrew.agents import ...
# from mycrews.qrew.tools import ...

__all__ = [] # No modules are exported for 'from mycrews.qrew import *'

# You could also add a version string here, e.g.
# __version__ = "0.2.0"
