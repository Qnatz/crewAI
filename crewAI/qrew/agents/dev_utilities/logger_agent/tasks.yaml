  - description: >
      Configure log shipping for the {application_name} application to send logs to {log_management_system} (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk).
      Set up log parsing and indexing in the log management system.
    expected_output: >
      Configuration files for log shipping agents (e.g., Filebeat, Fluentd).

  - description: >
      Define and implement application-level metrics to be exposed via a Prometheus endpoint for the {module_name} module.
      Metrics should include {list_of_metrics} (e.g., request counts, error rates, processing latency).
    expected_output: >
      Code changes to expose a /metrics endpoint in {module_name}.
      Documentation of the exposed metrics.
      Sample Prometheus query results.
