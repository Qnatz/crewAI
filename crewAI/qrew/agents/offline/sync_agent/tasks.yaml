  - description: >
      Develop a two-way data synchronization process between the local offline database and the central {backend_database_name} database for {data_entity_names}.
      Handle conflict resolution using a {conflict_resolution_strategy} (e.g., last-write-wins, user-prompt).
    expected_output: >
      A robust data synchronization mechanism.
      Data consistency maintained between local and remote stores.
      Clear logging of sync operations and conflict resolutions.
    agent: offline_sync_agent # Note: agent name updated for clarity

  - description: >
      Implement background synchronization that triggers automatically when the device regains network connectivity.
      Optimize for battery life and data usage.
    expected_output: >
      Background sync service that reliably syncs data when online.
      User-configurable settings for sync frequency or triggers (optional).
    agent: offline_sync_agent

  - description: >
      Provide users with visibility into the synchronization status (e.g., last synced time, pending uploads/downloads, errors).
      Allow users to manually trigger a sync if needed.
    expected_output: >
      UI components or notifications displaying sync status.
      A manual sync initiation option for the user.
