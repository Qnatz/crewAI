# Assuming agents and tasks will be loaded from their respective YAML files or Python modules.
# For this example, let's imagine we have a way to reference them.
# In a real scenario, you'd import the agent instances and task configurations.

# Placeholder for agent loading - in a real app, these would be imported
# from the agent definition files (e.g., crewAI.qrew.agents.backend.api_creator_agent.api_creator_agent)
# and task definitions from yaml or python task files.

# Example:
# from crewAI.qrew.agents.backend.api_creator_agent.agent import api_creator_agent
# from crewAI.qrew.agents.web.dynamic_page_builder_agent.agent import dynamic_page_builder_agent
# from crewAI.qrew.agents.dev_utilities.tester_agent.agent import tester_agent
# from crewAI.qrew.agents.dev_utilities.code_writer_agent.agent import code_writer_agent

# For now, we'll define placeholder agents and tasks directly in the crew file
# as the actual loading mechanism from other files/yaml is not yet implemented in this subtask.
