tasks:
  - description: >
      Review the {proposed_solution} (e.g., a technology stack, an architectural design, a specific tool)
      against the detailed {project_constraints_document}.
      Identify any violations or potential conflicts with budget, team skills, security policies,
      licensing agreements, or existing infrastructure.
    expected_output: >
      A constraint compliance report. This report should:
      - List each constraint and whether the proposed solution complies with it.
      - Detail any identified violations or areas of concern.
      - Provide recommendations for addressing non-compliance issues.
      - Confirm overall compliance if no issues are found.
    agent: constraint_checker_agent

  - description: >
      Assess the licensing implications of all components in the {proposed_tech_stack}.
      Ensure compatibility with project goals and company policies.
      Check for any open-source license conflicts or costly commercial licenses.
      Input: {list_of_technologies_and_tools}.
    expected_output: >
      A license compliance report detailing:
      - Licenses for each component in the stack.
      - Any identified conflicts or restrictions (e.g., copyleft requirements, commercial fees).
      - Confirmation of overall license compliance or a list of issues to be resolved.
    agent: constraint_checker_agent

  - description: >
      Evaluate the security constraints and compliance requirements for the {project_name} project.
      Check if the {proposed_architecture_or_stack} meets standards like {security_standard_1} (e.g., SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)
      and internal security policies.
    expected_output: >
      A security and compliance assessment report highlighting:
      - How the proposal meets or fails to meet specified security standards.
      - Any vulnerabilities or risks related to security constraints.
      - Recommendations for enhancing security posture if needed.
