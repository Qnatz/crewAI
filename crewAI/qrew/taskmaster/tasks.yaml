tasks:
  - description: >
      Analyze the incoming {user_request} or {project_goal_statement}.
      Clarify ambiguities and define the primary objectives, scope, and desired outcomes.
      Consult with the IdeaInterpreterAgent if the request is vague or needs significant refinement.
      Input: {user_request}, {project_goal_statement}, {priority_level}.
    expected_output: >
      A clear and concise project brief, including:
      - Defined scope and objectives.
      - Key deliverables and success criteria.
      - Initial assessment of complexity and potential challenges.
      - Recommendation for which orchestrator (e.g., ProjectArchitect, ExecutionManager) or Lead Agent should take the next step.
    agent: taskmaster_agent

  - description: >
      Based on the clarified project brief for {project_name}, determine the overall execution strategy.
      This involves deciding whether to first engage the ProjectArchitectAgent for design,
      the TechVettingCouncilAgent for technology choices, or directly the ExecutionManagerAgent for well-defined projects.
      Delegate the initial phase to the chosen orchestrator or lead agent.
      Input: {project_brief_document_url}, {organizational_priorities}.
    expected_output: >
      A high-level project initiation plan, specifying:
      - The first orchestrator or Lead Agent to be engaged.
      - The initial set of inputs and objectives for this first engagement.
      - A record of the delegation.
    agent: taskmaster_agent

  - description: >
      Track the handoff of the {project_name} to the designated orchestrator or Lead Agent.
      Ensure they have acknowledged receipt and have all necessary information to proceed.
      Log the initial delegation and set up a mechanism for receiving high-level status updates or completion notifications.
      Input: {project_name}, {delegated_agent_or_crew_name}, {handoff_confirmation_process}.
    expected_output: >
      Confirmation of successful handoff of {project_name}.
      Initial project state logged in a tracking system (conceptual).
      High-level monitoring plan established.
